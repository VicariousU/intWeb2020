        <h1>Wretches and Kings</h1>
        <p class = "soft">There's a time, when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it stop</p>

        <p class = "norm">To save face, how low can you go? Talk a lotta game, but yet you don't know. Static on the way, make us all say "whoa!" The people up top push the people down low.</p>

        <p class = "norm">Get down, and obey every word. Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard. Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd. Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt. If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know there ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload. And no one make a move, unless my people say so. Got everything outta control, now everybody go...</p>

        <p class = "soft">Steel unload, final blow. We, the animals, take control. Hear us now, clear and true. Wretches and kings, we come for you!</p>

        <p class = "norm">So keep pace, how slow can you go? Talk a lotta shit, and yet you don't know. Fire on the way, makes you all say "whoa!" The people up top and the people down low</p>

        <p class = "norm">Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that. The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at. Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat, the pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact, so get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know there ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no! So push the button, let the whole thing blow! Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go...</p>

        <p class = "soft">Steel unload, final blow. We, the animals, take control. Hear us now, clear and true. Wretches and kings, we come for you! Steel unload, fire blow, filthy animals beat down low! Skin and bone, black and blue! No more this sun shall beat onto you!</p>

        <p class = "soft">When the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that <a href = "../08iridescent/index.html">unless you're free</li></a>, the machine will be prevented from working at all!</p>
