        <h1>The Messenger</h1>
        <p>When you feel you're alone
Cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run
Listen to your heart
Those angel voices
They'll see you to you
They'll be your guide
Back home where life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind
When you suffered it all
And your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember your love
And you always will be
This melody will always bring
You right back home
When life leaves us blind
Love, keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
<a href = "../01radiance/index.html">Love keeps us kind</li></a></p>
