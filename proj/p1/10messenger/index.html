        <p class = "soft">When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world... Your instincts telling you to run. Listen to your heart, those angel voices, they'll see you to you, they'll be your guide back home where life leaves us blind... Love keeps us kind!</p>

        <p class = "soft">When you suffered it all, and your spirit is breaking, you're growing desperate from the fight... Remember your love and you always will be. This melody will always bring you right back home.</p>
