        <h1>Waiting for the End</h1>
        <p class = "norm">This is not the end, this is not the beginning, just a voice like a riot rocking every revision, but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm and though the words sound steady something empty's within 'em. We say, "yeah" fists flying up in the air like we're holding onto something that's invisible there because we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear until we dead it, forget it let it all disappear.</p>

        <p class = "exSoft">Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand. This is not what I had planned; It's out of my control. Flying at the speed of light, thoughts were spinning in my head. So many things were left unsaid; it's hard to let you go. I know what it takes to move on. I know how it feels to lie. All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding on to what I haven't got.</p>

        <p class = "soft">Sitting in an empty room, trying to forget the past. This was never meant to last. I wish it wasn't so... I know what it takes to move on. I know how it feels to lie. All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding on to what I haven't got...</p>

        <p class = "norm">What was left when that fire was gone? I thought it felt right but that right was wrong. All caught up in the eye of the storm and trying to figure out what it's like moving on. And I don't even know what kind of things I've said; my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead, so picking up the pieces, now where to begin? The hardest part of ending is starting again.</p>
