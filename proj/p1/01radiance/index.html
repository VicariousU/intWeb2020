        <h1>The Radiance</h1>
        <p>We knew the world would not be the same</p>
        <p>A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent</p>
        <p>I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita</p>
        <p>Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty</p>
        <p>And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says</p>
        <p>Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds</p>
        <p>I suppose we all thought that, one way or another</p>
