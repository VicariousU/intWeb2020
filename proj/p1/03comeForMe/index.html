        <h1>When They Come For Me</h1>
        <p class="norm">I am not a pattern to be followed, the pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow. I'm not a criminal, not a role model, not a born leader; I'm a tough act to follow. I am not the fortune and the fame or the same verse I'm telling you to forfeit the game. I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and I found out the underbelly is sicker than it seems, and it seems uglyâ€” but it can get worse. 'Cause even the blueprint is a gift and a curse. 'Cause once you have the theory of how the thing works, everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first. And I'm not a <a href = "../04robotBoy/index.html">robot</a>, I'm not a monkey. I will not dance even if the beat's funky. Opposite of lazy, far from a punk. Ya'll oughta stop talking, start tryna catch up!</p>

        <p class="norm"> Lauryn said money change a situation. Big said it increase the complication. Kane said, "Don't step, I ain't the one." Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton. And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me, rocking every stage and every place that they brought me. I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it. And so it ain't mistaken, I'ma state it for the record: I am the opposite of whack, opposite of weak, opposite of slack, synonym of heat, synonym of crack, closest to a peak, far from a punk. Ya'll oughta stop talking, start tryna catch up!</p>
