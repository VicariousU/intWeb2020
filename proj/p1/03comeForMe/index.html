        <h1>When They Come For Me</h1>
        <p>Yeah,
I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on
Is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal
Not a role model
Not a born leader
I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortunate and the fame
Or the same verse I'm telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly is sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse,
'Cause even the blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you have the theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a <a href = "../04robotBoy/index.html">robot</li></a>
I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk ya'll
Stop talking, start tryna catch up mother fucker
And all the people say
Aah, aah, aah
Tryin' to catch up mother fucker
Aah, aah, aah
Lauren said money changes situations
Big said it increases the complication
Kane said don't stab, I ain't the one
Chuck said that an Uzi weigh a mother fucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me
I'm awfully underrated
But can be corrected
And so this second I'm gonna save it for the record
I am the opposite of whack
Opposite of weak
Opposite of slack
Standing in the heat
Standing in a crack
Closest to a beat, far from a punk
Ya'll outta stop talking, start tryna catch up mother fucker
And all the people say</p>
