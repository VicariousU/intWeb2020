        <h1>Blackout</h1>
          <p class = "norm">I'm stuck in this bed you made, alone with a sinking feeling. I saw through the words you said to the secrets you've been keeping. It's written upon your face, all the lies how they cut so deeply. You can't get enough you take and take and take and never say</p>

          <p>No, you've gotta get it inside! You push it back down, you push it back down</p>
          <p>No, you'll never get it inside! Push it back down, black out, blood in your eye...</p>

          <p class = "norm"> You say that it's not your fault and swear that I am mistaken. You said it's not what it seems; no remorse for the trust you're breaking. You run but then back you fall, suffocate in the mess you're making. You can't get enough you take and take and take and take and take.</p>

          <p>Fuck it, are you listening!?</p>

          <p>No, you've gotta get it inside! You push it back down, you push it back down</p>
          <p>No, you'll never get it inside! Push it back down, black out, blood in your eye...</p>

          <p class = "soft">Floating down, as colors fill the light. We look up from the ground in fields of paper white. And floating up you pass us in the night. <a href = "../07wretches/index.html">A future gazing out</li></a> a past to overwrite. So come down far below. We've been waiting to collect the things you know. Come down far below. We've been waiting to collect what you've let go...</p>

          <p class = "exSoft">Come down low...</p>
