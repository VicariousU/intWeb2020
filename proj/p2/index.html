        <p>Design a responsive single page site.</p>
        <p>You will design a mobile version (320px), tablet version (768px), small desktop version (1024px), and large desktop version (1440px).</p>
        <p>The content of the site is up to you but you should have text, images, and links to external sites.</p>
        <p>The digital versions should be built in Illustrator, XD, or Sketch.</p>
        <p>Some ideas could be a site for a current issue, a site re-presenting a longform article, a site acting as a type specimen, or any some other content source.</p>
