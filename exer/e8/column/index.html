      <div class="column"> <p>Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing. Analytically, I assault, animate things. Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat. Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding. Casually create catastrophes, casualties. Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing. Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough. Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low</p> </div>
      <div class="column" id="mar"> <p>Yeah, levitatin' off the blacktop. Used to struggle getting started now I can't stop. Used to be the quiet kid in the sandbox, now it's "Hands up" every time that your man rocks. You oughta stop me coming in again. You mad? You thought we were synonyms. Too bad, that's the water you're getting in, you're too fat for the sharks that you're swimming in. Where I'm sitting contenders are lookin' like fruits spinnin' around in a blender; Hardly a snack when I'm here lookin' for dinner. I eat 'em, delete 'em, they're barely beginners. Main course is my main sport. Play major, but Minor's my main fort. Put a chain around everything I came for, look but don't touch sucka, tell 'em take an I.O.U</p> </div>
      <div class="column"> <p>I'm walking to the something, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah. And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.</p> </div>
